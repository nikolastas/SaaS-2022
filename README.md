**Microservices** <br>
Each microservice is implemented in its own folder as shown in the github hierarchy. Inside each microservice folder there is one README that explains whta this microservice does.

**Cloud implementation** <br>
In order to use the cloud services, we used the free trials provided by them and so, the resourses and the time that they are 'online' is limited.
