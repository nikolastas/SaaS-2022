# FTPAPI
This api was used in the early stages of the project. 
It is basicly a REST API wich a get call of each type (AGRT, ATL, FF) of csv file would get the specified csv file through https.

# To test it :
You need to create a certificate and add it to the api and to the cookies of the GET request. 
To learn more about the cookie check the certificate folder.
